cats! --> make it so people can redeem points to adopt a cat from a group of cats made by me (pixelated with names and personalities) not sure if this is even possible

📜 VyleyBot Command Roadmap
✅ Core (Basics Cog)

!hello → Simple greeting to confirm bot is alive. ✅
 ---> Update: Maybe something personal and automatic for viewers joining? With a hard coded option for specific OG followers/subs that join and lurk but support?

!ping → Responds with “Pong 🏓” to test responsiveness. ✅

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community / Fun

!lurk → Sends a thank-you message for lurking. ✅

!hug <user> → Sends a hug to the specified user. ✅

!8ball <question> → Random yes/no/maybe response (Magic 8-ball). ✅

!roll <sides> → Dice roll (e.g., !roll 20 → “You rolled a 14 🎲”). 

!quote → Pulls a random saved quote from chat (needs simple DB or JSON). 

!addquote <text> → Saves a memorable moment/quote (mod-only).

+50 -> add by 1 to a counter every time Vy says +50

-1 -> add by 1 to a counter every time Vy misses a canon

🎮 Stream Utility

!uptime → Shows how long the stream has been live (via Twitch API).

!title → Displays the current stream title.

!game → Displays the current stream game/category.

!so <user> → Shoutout another streamer with their Twitch link.

🔒 Mod / Admin

!banphrase <word> → Add word to a banlist (DB-backed).

!unbanphrase <word> → Remove word from the banlist.

!commands → List all available commands.

!reload <cog> → Hot-reload a cog without restarting bot (advanced).

📦 Future Ideas

Points system → Track loyalty/participation.

Mini-games → Slots, duel, coinflip, word games.

Integration → Spotify now playing, Discord cross-posts, OBS integration.
